## Personal Portfolio

The repository contains a Software Developer Portfolio Template built with React.JS and Next.JS, which is reflective of my work, projects, education, achievements, skills as an aspiring Software developer. Some salient features include:-
 - Built with a modern web design approach that allows websites and pages to render (or display) on all devices and screen sizes by automatically adapting to the screen, whether it's a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.
 - A beautiful Interface making the user-experience extremely soothing ,highlighting details of each section.
 - Modular File Folder React Structure allowing the file manipulation tasks to be dealt with extreme ease.
 -  Built With Next. js, with the capacity to render the JavaScript code on the server and send simple indexable HTML to the user.
